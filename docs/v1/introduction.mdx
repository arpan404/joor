## What is Joor?

In simple words, a backend framework designed with performance, efficiency, and scalability in mind.

Joor is built on top of the Node.js HTTP module, featuring a fast and reliable routing system with various inbuilt tools and features, eliminating the need for third-party packages for simple tasks. It is completely type-safe and can run on Node.js, Bun, and Deno. Designed to strike a balance between abstraction overhead and developer experience, Joor offers an efficient and smooth development process.

## Key features

#### Simplicity

Joor is incredibly simple to use. If you're familiar with basic JavaScript, you can easily build an auto-scaling backend system with Joor. Its simplicity allows developers to focus on writing logic instead of dealing with complex configurations.

#### Scalablility and Efficiency

Joor is designed with scalability and efficiency in mind. Its auto-scaling feature enables you to build highly performant, self-scaling backend systems with just a few lines of code. With minimal abstraction overhead, Joor performs similarly to native runtime HTTP modules, making it a powerful tool for handling high loads.

#### Configuration

Joor offers extensive configurability, allowing you to tailor it to meet the specific needs of your project. Whether you're working on a small service or a large application, Joor can be easily configured to suit your requirements.

#### Security and Reliability

Joor is built with security and reliability at its core. It undergoes rigorous testing and benchmarking before each new release, ensuring that you can trust it to run securely and efficiently in production environments.

#### Routing and Middlewares

Joor supports various routing styles and comes with a set of inbuilt middlewares to simplify common backend tasks. You can easily customize or extend these middlewares to fit your application's needs.

#### Modern and Type-Safe

Built on TypeScript, Joor ensures type safety throughout your backend application, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality. It takes full advantage of modern JavaScript features, making it a reliable and forward-thinking choice for backend development.
